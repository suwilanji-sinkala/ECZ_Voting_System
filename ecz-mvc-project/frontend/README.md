# Ecz MVC Project - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Ecz MVC Project, built using React. It interacts with the backend API to provide a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecz-mvc-project/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application.
- `src/components/App.jsx`: Main component that includes routing and layout.
- `src/controllers/index.js`: Functions for interacting with the backend API.
- `src/models/index.js`: Data models and state management for the frontend.
- `src/views/Home.jsx`: Home view component displaying data from the backend.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations. Ensure that the backend server is running to fetch and manipulate data.
